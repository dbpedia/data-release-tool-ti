# Object properties extracted with mappings
Highest quality object properties from the Wikipedia Infoboxes extracted by the mappings extraction. 

TODO describe the whole dataset and mapping process briefly


Derived from uncleaned mappingbased-objects by post-processing:
* type consistency, i.e. type of object matches the range of property
* redirecting of objects, i.e. http://dbpedia.org/resource/Billl_Clinton to Bill Clinton
